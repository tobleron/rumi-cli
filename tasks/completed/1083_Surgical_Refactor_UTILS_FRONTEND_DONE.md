# Task 1083: Surgical Refactor UTILS FRONTEND

## Objective
## ⚡ Surgical Objective
**Role:** Senior Refactoring Engineer
**Goal:** De-bloat module to < 2.00 Drag Score.
**Strategy:** Extract highlighted 'Hotspots' into sub-modules.
**Optimal State:** The file becomes a pure 'Orchestrator' or 'Service', with complex math/logic moved to specialized siblings.

### 🚨 Hotspots (Focus Area)
The following regions are calculated to be the most confusing for AI:
