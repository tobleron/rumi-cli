  "merge_objective": "### 📚 Metric Legend\n* **Context Efficiency Score:** A measure of folder fragmentation. High scores indicate a high 'Read Tax'.\n* **Read Tax:** The cumulative token and time cost incurred when an AI has to switch between many small files.\n\n### 🎯 General Instruction\nConsolidate the following folders to reach a Context Efficiency Score below {merge_t}. \nYou have full architectural autonomy to merge related small files into cohesive modules while ensuring all external references are updated and the original fragmented structure is pruned.",
