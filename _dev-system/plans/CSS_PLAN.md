*   **LOC:** Total non-comment lines. (Lower is easier to read).
*   **Drag:** Complexity multiplier. (Target: < 2.0). High Drag means AI agents struggle to track state.
*   **Cognitive Capacity:** Inference energy required (Goal: < 100%).
*   **Read Tax:** Tokens and time overhead incurred when switching between many small files.
*   **AI Context Fog:** Regions of code with overlapping logic paths that cause model hallucination.
